# Natural Language Processing with Deep Neural Networks
Hello everyone, ive recently just concluded a project i've been working on for some time now. Natural Language Processing (NLP), this is a fascinating field at the intersection of artificial intelligence, linguistics, and computer science. It focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. From chatbots and sentiment analysis to machine translation and text summarization. 



The first part of this project contains a sentiment analysis where In this project, we dive into NLP by building a deep learning model capable of detecting sarcasm in news headlines. Using a dataset of headlines labeled as either sarcastic or not, we’ll explore key NLP techniques such as tokenization, word embeddings, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to train a model that can discern subtle nuances in text.



The second part of this project showcases the incredible potential of natural language processing and deep learning in generating human-like text, particularly in the creative realm of poetry. By training a Bidirectional LSTM model on poetic lines, we’ve enabled it to capture the nuances of language, structure, and style, allowing it to generate new verses based on a given prompt. The model successfully learned to predict the next word in a sequence, creating coherent and contextually relevant poetry. 

The sarcasm json dataset used for the sentiment analysis is provided within the folder.
